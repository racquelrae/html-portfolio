<h1>Best Movies Ever According to Me (Rac)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies (as of right now)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lego Batman</h3>
<p>Do I even need to explain why? I don't think so.</p>
<h3>Mr. Nobody</h3>
<p>I like how it makes you think about all the different ways your life could have turned out based on simple decisions you make.</p>
<h3>Minimalism</h3>
<p>This helped change my outlook on life and I still strive to keep these values in mind.</p>
